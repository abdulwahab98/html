        Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

        <br>
    <button>Learn More</button>
                </div>

                  Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
                   Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
                   a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,
                    a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, 
                    though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
